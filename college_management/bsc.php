               <p class="mt-3 mb-30">A Bachelor of Science (BSc) course is an undergraduate program typically focused on scientific disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, or environmental science. It provides students with a solid foundation in theoretical knowledge and practical skills relevant to their chosen field of study. BSc programs often emphasize critical thinking, problem-solving, experimentation, and research methodologies. Depending on the specialization, students may engage in laboratory work, fieldwork, or computer-based simulations to deepen their understanding of scientific principles. The duration of a BSc course is typically three to four years, and graduates may pursue various career paths including scientific research, academia, industry, healthcare, technology, environmental conservation, or government agencies. Additionally, some students may choose to pursue further education such as a Master's or PhD degree to specialize further in their field or advance their careers.</p>
